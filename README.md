# AUDIO-ENHANCEMENT-USING-KALMAN-AND-WIENER-FILTER

In this project, the investigation of the enhancement of speech by applying Kalman and Wiener filter. Noise removal is particularly important in many applications like telephone conversation, speech recognition, etc. The corruption of speech due to presence of additive background noise causes severe difficulties in various communication environments. The presence of this background noise in speech significantly reduces the intelligibility of speech. Degradation of speech severely affects the ability of person, whether impaired or normal hearing, to understand what the speaker is saying. The Kalman filter which is an efficient recursive filter that estimates the internal state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. This project compares the results of Kalman filter with spectral subtraction, wiener filter and found Kalman filter has shown good improvement in MSE values, Correlation, SNR, etc., few of the parameters for validation is analyzed.
